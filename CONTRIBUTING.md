# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving `ts-yaml-code-graph`! This project is a TypeScript library and CLI published to npm. Bug reports, ideas, and pull requests are welcome.

## Project structure
- `src/`: Source for the CLI (`cli.ts`) and library modules
- `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript and type declarations generated by `npm run build`

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Development workflow

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run build
```

Please ensure the build succeeds before submitting changes. If you add new functionality, prefer to keep the CLI and exported library API in sync.
